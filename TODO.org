*  IDEAS
** Source: Blackbird - https://github.com/butor/blackbird/blob/master/README.md
- Trading concurrently on long and short positions based on spread between exchanges
- Position entered at a large spread between a pair of exchanges
- Position exists when pair of exchanges shrinks
- Exchanges:
  - Kraken
  - Bitfinex
  - OKCoin
  - BitStamp
  - Gemini
  - EXMO
  - QuadrigaCX
  - Polonlex
  - GDAX
  - BTC-e
  - itBit
  - CEX.IO
- Bitfinex and Kraken seems to be the most well-respected exchanges
** Bitfinex
*** API Docs: https://docs.bitfinex.com/docs
*** https://github.com/cyberpunk-ventures/bitfinex_ex
- Last maintained: Nov 26, 2016
- HTTPoison
- Two public methods, might as well write my own
- Org https://github.com/cyberpunk-ventures seems to have some interesting things
** Kraken
*** API Docs: https://www.kraken.com/help/api
*** https://github.com/x-ji/kraken_api/blob/master/lib/kraken_api.ex
- Most recently maintained (last commit: Oct 2017)
- Uses HTTPoison
- Written by a student? Code is kinda messy but straight-forward
*** https://github.com/1st8/exkraken
- Recently-maintained (last commit: Aug 2017)
- Also uses HTTPoison
- Does not look as complete as kraken_api
*** https://github.com/parubets/kraken_elixir
- Recently-maintained (last commit: Jun 2017)
- Also uses HTTPoison
- Seems to have the most number of endpoints implemented
*** Maybe write my own, somewhere between kraken_api and karaken_elixir
** Bittrex- https://bittrex.com/
*** Not on Blackbird, but worth a shot?
