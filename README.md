# Trader

This is based on [Blackbird](https://github.com/butor/blackbird).

This is a personal project that is more of an excuse to code with Elixir. This
is not meant as production-ready code. The author (Ho-Sheng Hsiao) warrants
nothing. Use this code at your own risk. You may want to run Blackbird instead.

## Developer Notes

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
